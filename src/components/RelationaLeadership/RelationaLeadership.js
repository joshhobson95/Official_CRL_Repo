    <h2>RelationaLeadership Model</h2>
    <p>Our approach sees relational leadership as a developmental process that takes place on two separate but interdependent scales. These scales mirror the relational learning scale where relationships can be developed and progressed in four stages, (1) recognition, (2) understanding, (3) valuing, and finally (4) co-creating and co-sponsoring.</p>
    <p>In our approach leading relationally is developed by simultaneously increasing the leader's satisfaction, joy, and happiness and their impact. A client will be able to uncover current patterns of engagement in their relationships. These patterns of relating to others reveal what stage of relating is dominant and then sensibilities and practices are developed to consciously take one to the highest levels of relationship. The chart below is a visual of this dynamic process.</p>
