    <h2>Relational Programs</h2>
    <p>George Otero and associates have pioneered unique ways of putting the relationship first in classrooms, organizations, and personal development. They have emphasized relational ways of learning through such varied modalities as -play, games, story, dialog, art and ceremony- in all programs, presentations, workshops and training over the last 45 years.</p>
    <p>This emphasis on relationships first has resulted in innovative, proven practices and initiatives that demonstrate how an intentional focus on who you are in relation to self and others results in increased joy, satisfaction, impact and success in life and work.</p>
    <p>Our programs are available online and in person in a variety of formats. Coaching and consulting are often done both virtually and in person. Experiential leadership and learning programs are also offered in a variety of formats including: training sessions, seminars and site-based travel.</p>
