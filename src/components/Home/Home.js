<h1 class="freehand_header">Join Us On The Journey To Put Relationships First</h1>
<p>RelationaLeadership and RelationaLearning has helped thousands of individuals and scores of schools, community groups, and organizations to develop competency in what we call RelationaLeadership and Relationalearning. Throughout our four decades of working with educators from the US, the UK, and Australia, we have developed theories and practices for learning and leading relationally. We believe skillfully placing relationships first in all our interactions holds the key to personal and professional success, and contributes most to our becoming better human beings. Our research, publications, programs, and collaborations highlight and support the primacy of Relationships First in making our organizations, schools, and communities places of equity, justice, hope, achievement, and joy for all. <a href="https://dev.relationalearning.com/history/">Learn More </a></p>

<h3>From the classroom...</h3>
<p class="classroom">The Center for RelationaLearning&trade; prioritizes relationships to empower educators, preparing them to inspire and educate both current and future learners. Instead of solely enhancing teaching practices, our focus is on the well-being and connections of educators, recognizing that the quality of relationships dictates the quality of learning. By improving teachers' ability to authentically relate, teaching practices are also enriched. Our programs, including keynote presentations, workshops, and professional development initiatives, equip educators with transformative strategies for success. Through RelationaLeadership Institutes, we cultivate a collaborative environment where educators build trust, exchange ideas, and learn from one another. Additionally, we offer curriculum resources and relationship-based instructional materials, empowering educators to create engaging learning experiences for themselves and their students.</p>
