    <h3>The power of positive relationships</h3>
    <p>Year by year the evidence pours in about the critical role parents, family and the wider community play in education overall and school learning in particular. In addition, the interdependence of achievement, wellbeing and life chances is accepted more readily than before. In this paper I will share evidence, principles and practices that schools can use to build positive and productive relationships across the school and community</p>
