<h3><b>Dialogue for Democracy</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relational leaders have the responsibility to promote and lead dialogue especially when our communities and nations are so divided and three years of Covid isolation has significantly reduced the amount and quality of communication and talk between us. Without dialogue, democracy withers. Relational leaders feel a call to bring us all back to democratic engagement through dialogue. How do we get back to that democratic discussion that is so essential?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dialogue for Democracy explores these ideas by attempting to answer 6 foundational questions, both through discussion and with discussion activities. </span></p>
<ol class="publication_one_ol">
	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is dialogue valuable?</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are some of the conditions for good dialogue?</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are some good ways to get the dialogue started?</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are some good ways to keep dialogue going?</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can we deepen dialogue?</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can we connect dialogue to action?</span></li>
</ol>
<p>We think this little book could be quite useful to people who are engaged in discussions about dialogue and eager to try out different strategies and methods with their team or school.</p>
