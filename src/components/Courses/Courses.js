<h3>Teaching with the Relational Mind</h3>
<p>
Relational work is very personal, and every individual will work relationally in a different and subjective way. This course will help you bring your authentic self to your teaching. Discovering who you are relationally can help you then foster that discovery in others. Participants will engage in an in-depth analysis of their personal relational mindset, as they gain knowledge on how to practice and maintain this. A relational mindset will help any educator increase the engagement of learners, families, and everyone within a schoolâ€™s orbit.
