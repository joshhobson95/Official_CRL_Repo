<h2>George Otero</h2>
<h3>Co-Director</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born and raised in New Mexico, USA, Dr. George Otero is well known as an international consultant, social entrepreneur, and author. Otero has worked with a diverse body of clients throughout the USA, Australia, and the UK. George has spent his career insisting that positive relationships are the key to effective education, learning, and leadership. Relationships First are the result. He learned from thousands of conversations and social interactions that putting the relationship first in every aspect of personal and organizational life results in positive growth, joy, happiness, and success. These insights and practices apply to everyone. He discovered how play, games, story, dialog, art (music, dance, food), and ceremony were ways of relating that could empower participants of any age or stage to intentionally create the way they were relating. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">More recently in his work with hundreds of organizations, schools communities, and thousands of individuals, he has been highly successful in helping individuals, teams and social systems put relationships first in all they do; transforming sense of self, organizational culture, and strengthening community. Learning how to be relational first has led in every case to greater equity, inclusion, social justice, and organizational and personal alignment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">His work is designed for each client and tailored to their specific relational needs.</span></p>
