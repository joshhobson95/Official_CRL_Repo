<h3>Our History</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Center’s history is embedded in the sacred landscape of Northern New Mexico. For more than 20 years the Center formed its mission and practice while based at the Historic Mabel Dodge Luhan House in Taos, New Mexico. As a multicultural and multi-age living and learning center, Dr. Otero and associates hosted and facilitated hundreds of workshops, retreats, and conferences on Global and Multicultural Education, New Mexico History, and Culture. We at CRL have always been pushing against the standard paradigm of education. We have been reforming the culture of teaching, learning, and leading since the 70s beginning with global, multicultural, diversity, and inclusion issues, emerging into a focus on relational learning and community leadership, and parent and community engagement across England, Australia and New Mexico. Most recently the focus since 2015 has been relational leadership development.</span></p>

<h3>Southwest to Outback</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Our pioneering work reflects the changing global context. First, we focused on building American’s awareness of the global interdependence in which we all live. Learning and accepting our connectedness in the face of differences, conflicts, and challenges has led us to assist diverse school communities across the US, Australia, and England to develop a relational mindset and the corresponding skills and strategies that promote equity, tolerance, goodwill, and interconnection. As a result of working in so many different communities, we have developed new ways for people to connect and relate to each other. A powerful expression of our unique approach has been the 20 years of learning journeys between the people of Australia and New Mexico.</span></p>

<h3>Onward</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we move through the impacts of isolation and disconnection created by the global pandemic and the emerging challenges of AI and social media, many now realize we are not meant to live disconnected, either from ourselves or each other. More people than ever want a relational approach to life to counter the acceleration of anxiety, alienation, loneliness, and apathy. As we move forward we have adapted, refined, and reformed our approach to best suit the newly emerging ways we live and work together.</span></p>
